Hey there! I am Sulaiman :computer: :smile:

I recently graduated from [McMaster University, Hamilton](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). During my Master's program, I had the opportunity to work with [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en) as a Full-Stack Software Developer in the [Ericsson Indoor Planner](https://www.ericsson.com/en/portfolio/networks/ericsson-radio-system/radio/small-cells/indoor/ericsson-indoor-planner). I collaborated with a cross-functional team throughout the software development life cycle of the Ericsson Indoor Planner (EIP) web application, including analysis, design, coding, testing, integration, and maintenance; optimized project efficiency and ensured successful delivery.

Before moving to Canada, I worked as a software Developer at [Infosys Ltd](https://www.infosys.com/). I have a keen interest in the intersection of software engineering and Data Science, with a strong focus on contributing effectively to the evolving landscape of data-driven technologies.
